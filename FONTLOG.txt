OSP-Crickx is a digital reinterpretation of a set of adhesive letters.

The Publi Fluor shop was situated in the northern part of Brussels,
Schaerbeek, and founded by the father of Madame Christelle Crickx who
was a trained letter painter. In his day he is—it seems—the first to propose
fluorescent colors for shopwindow signs. It proves so difficult to paint
letters on site with that kind of unstable coating that he develops a
technique based on vinyl that he fluo-colors and cuts by hand in the
workplace, then sticks at clients shops. Around 1975, his health degrades
quickly and his daughter is forced to step into the business.

Starting to cut letters with the rounded and skilled cardboard
templates drawn by her father, Madame Crickx slowly morphs the shapes
by analysing how typographic niceties confuse her non-trained clients
and leads to bad letters placement. She progressively removes the
optical compensation of rounded tops and bottoms, straightens sides,
and attaches accents for less floating parts. Those moves add a very
specific orientation to this otherwise quite common bold italic sans
serif display typeface.

During about fifty years these craft lettres have spread across the
windows of shopping streets, more and more, and after the
closure of the shop in the early noughties, they seem to still hold
their own to the assaults of vector vinyl cutting technology.
